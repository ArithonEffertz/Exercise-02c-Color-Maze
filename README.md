Exercise for MSCH-C220, 15 September 2020

A simple game exploring physics bodies, collision layers, scenes, and signals

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.2

## References
None

## Future Development
To make this game better I could add more movement options for the player, faster speeds for the changing cubes, levels with different colors and challenges, enemies, a high score, a timer so you only have so long to beat the level, maybe even a story on the reason why.
